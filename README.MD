# MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) Inventory Interface

In this project, MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js were used to build an
inventory interface. This interface allows the user to create inventory items,
browse inventory items, search for inventory items, update inventory items,
and delete inventory items. Each inventory item must have a title, but can also
have a description, some relevant keywords, and an image.
